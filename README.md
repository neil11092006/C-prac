# C-prac — CS50 Problem Set Projects

This repository contains my C programming projects from Harvard's CS50 course. These projects showcase my understanding of core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, arrays, functions, strings, and algorithmic problem solving.

## 📁 Projects

### 🔐 Caesar Cipher (`caesar/caesar.c`)
Implements a classic Caesar cipher encryption tool.
- Concepts: Command-line arguments, ASCII manipulation, modular arithmetic.
- Skills: String traversal, argument parsing, encryption logic.

### 📖 Readability (`readability/readability.c`)
Analyzes text to compute a U.S. grade level readability score using the Coleman-Liau index.
- Concepts: String processing, formula implementation, counting letters, words, and sentences.
- Skills: Conditionals, text parsing, floating point math.

### 🧱 Mario Pyramid (`mario/mario.c`)
Recreates a right-aligned Mario-style pyramid using loops and user input.
- Concepts: Loops and input validation.
- Skills: Nested loops, formatting output with spaces and hashes.

### 💳 Credit Card Validator (`credit/credit.c`)
Validates credit card numbers using Luhn's Algorithm and identifies card type (AMEX, VISA, MASTERCARD).
- Concepts: Mathematical logic, digit manipulation.
- Skills: Modulo arithmetic, number parsing, condition chaining.

### 🔤 Scrabble (`scrabble/scrabble.c`)
Implements a basic version of the game Scrabble that scores words based on letter values.
- Concepts: Arrays and scoring systems.
- Skills: Case-insensitive input handling, array lookups.

## 💻 How to Run

Each project can be compiled with `make` and run via command line:

```bash
cd caesar
make caesar
./caesar 2
